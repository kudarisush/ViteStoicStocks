# Stoic Stocks (Frontend)

Stoic Stocks is a small practice app built with **Next.js** and **React**. The long-term goal is to let users **register with a name + phone number** (phone as an identifier) and **paper trade among 4 stocks**.

This repo contains the **frontend** application.

## Features (current + planned)

### MVP (in progress / planned)
- Simple UI to view 4 supported stocks
- Paper trading workflow:
    - Buy / sell with virtual cash
    - Track holdings and simple P&L
- Basic “registration”:

    - Phone number (used as the ID)

### Nice-to-haves (later)
- Trade history + activity feed
- Simple charts
- Leaderboard / “most stoic trader” stats
- Input validation + better UX for onboarding
